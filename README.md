Power calculator in R Shiny to facilitate trial design calculations

This shiny app is intended to fill the specific needs of 1AF trial designers. Specifically, the app translates the language of power calculations to the language of 1AF research resource use efficiecy. The current functions are:

* Decision threshold - a calculator that provides a menu of options based on scale decision thresholds
* Minimum detectable effect - a calculator that converts available sample into measurable differences
* Positive predictive value - a calculator that puts p-values in context based on a priori likelihoods of hypotheses being valid to support trial scale decision making.
